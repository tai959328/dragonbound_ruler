Built for screen resolution 1920x1080. To be used with machine Boomer with full power shots and no wind.

# How To Use
Value 0 is where your machine is.

Each number away from 0 is the number of degrees from 90. Your shot should land at that number.

For example, number 3 to the right of 0 is where the shot should land if Boomer shot at full power at 87 degrees to the right.

Account for height differences between your machine and the opponent machine.
